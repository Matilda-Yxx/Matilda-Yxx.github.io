    <title>Neruda, I</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>20 March, 2020<br><small><em>This poem was written as my tribute to Neruda’s Poem: Tonight I Can Write the Saddest Lines.</em></small><br><br><br></p>
<p>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>Inside my mind I shrieked until I turned mute,<br>silence befallen and the eternal song died.</p>
<p>All the tiny beautiful things<br>that sewed us together,<br>now winding into a long thin strand<br>Entangling my lungs, robbing me of my life.<br>Your disappearance leaves me in a continuous void of emotionlessness.</p>
<p>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.</p>
<p>Your smell had been strolling at the edge of my mind,<br>driving me mad, mad at the fact now<br>even my olfaction is under your tyrannous reign — Also my vision,<br>constantly being invaded by your loving, soft eyes. Also my hands and body,<br>desperately seeking those counterparts of mine. Also my ears,<br>echoing Chopin’s ballades that you played for me,<br>thus away I pined.</p>
<p>Tonight I can write the saddest lines;<br>no, I couldn’t. For as long I could write, I was still alive.<br>I could still write when thinking of your being by my side.<br>Your eyes would wet as I read to you my poem then you would hug me tight.<br>As this fog of happy illusions gradually lifted, from this world was I effaced.</p>

<p>I had almost nothing back then<br>Neither blossoms nor fruits<br>My leaves were dim and my branches bare<br>Then you took me home, and we had one another.</p>
<p>I was happy and comfortable<br>Sitting in the nutritious, warm soil<br>No mores pests intruding my lovely siestas<br>There’s nothing else I’d ask for.</p>
<p>But soon I started to feel <br>A bit lethargic, fatigued<br>As if part of my youth was drained.</p>
<p>Still, I gave all I have<br>To permeate your house with aroma<br>And to grow the little green ones <br>Just to win your angel-like laughters<br>and delightful eyes. <br>Do you know that I love you so?</p>
<p>Time gone by, and there came a day<br>we had a new home.<br>I was left in the balcony, the sky was bright<br>And my body blazed with refreshed vitality.<br>I realised by then, that all I had truly needed<br>was sunshine. Eternal sunshine.</p>
<p>Polished, soft green leaves<br>start to crown my head<br>They gently swayed in the wind.<br>I knew that you were happy for me<br>And so was I, happy for you.<br>Because</p>
<p>I see you<br>kissed her in the moonlight,<br>I see you<br>stunned at the mesmerising sunset<br>I see you<br>lost yourself with the piano<br>your silhouette bathed in the warm, amber light.</p>
<p>Do you know that I love you so?<br>I think you do.</p>
