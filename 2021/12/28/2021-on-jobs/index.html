    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">

      
        <p>I am now at (hopefully!) the latter half of my Ph.D. journey. I have been thinking really hard about what kind of work I would like to do in the future. After reading quite extensively on the topic of “jobs”, as well as having deep conversations with my friends of different backgrounds and walks of life, I would like to talk about some of my personal observations on “jobs”. I will probably talk about the specific career paths that I have carefully considered in a separate post in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Passion"><a href="#Passion" class="headerlink" title="Passion"></a>Passion</h1><p>One of the most hotly debated topics around “jobs” is whether one should pick the profession that one is most passionate about. You would hear a lot of (already) highly successful people preaching about the importance of “do what you love”: if you fail to do what you truly love, you would not become very successful. I kinda agree with that. But their argument overlooked one important aspect: Even if you pursue a career of what you love, there is no guarantee that you’d become successful.</p>
<p>Why? First, there is an old saying goes that: <strong>where there’s muck, there’s brass.</strong> Unpleasant work pays; the most creative and interesting kinds of jobs are few, and usually don’t pay that well, particularly at the start of one’s career (e.g. jobs in the design industry). Second, what you love as a profession may not be quite valuable (in monetary terms) in today’s world. Third, external factors do matter in terms of determining one’s success (you may want to read the book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell if you haven’t done so). Lastly and most importantly - becoming “successful” is not essential to “living a happy life” - so being successful may not even be a universal pursuit for everyone in the first place.</p>
<h1 id="The-two-routes"><a href="#The-two-routes" class="headerlink" title="The two routes"></a>The two routes</h1><p>There are two routes when it comes down to determining one’s career path. For this topic, I’d just borrow Paul Graham’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">definitions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the organic route: Do what you love. But at the start, your job might involve parts that you don’t love. As you become more eminent, gradually increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of those you don’t. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the two-job route: to work at things you don’t like that much (as a day-job) to get money to work on things you do actually love.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Organic-route"><a href="#Organic-route" class="headerlink" title="Organic route"></a>Organic route</h2><p>There is one issue with choosing the organic route, though. You must be very true to yourself when it comes down to deciding “what is the thing that you love to do”. There are two very common confounders here: dexterity and desire.</p>
<p><em>Dexterity</em> matters. For certain fields, you have to accumulate a considerable amount of knowledge and skills even before you could build something tangible out of it. And by being able to build something fully functional and tangible, it’s probably not that easy to fall in love with what you do. The steeper the learning curve and the longer of the development cycle is, the later it is for you to truly appreciate the beauty of your work. </p>
<p>For example, conducting scientific research is a very typical process with an extremely long cycle time and steep learning curve (for an averaged person). At the opposite end of this axis, picking up a camera and capturing an eye-pleasing photo is very easy and quick to learn these days. For most people, it might be much easier to fall in love with photography than scientific research.</p>
<p>The second common confounder would be <em>desire</em>. What you love and what you desire might be two different things. Common desires include prestige and money. When you try to pin down what you truly love, your decision should not be clouded by what you (or your family) desire. For example, one day you tell yourself that you’d want to become a doctor. Do you want to become a doctor because of the prestige of this profession? Or do you truly enjoy studying human anatomy and spending time with patients (which is probably hard to know)? The latter question probably matters more than the former in the long-term.</p>
<h2 id="Two-job-route"><a href="#Two-job-route" class="headerlink" title="Two-job route"></a>Two-job route</h2><p>As of the two-job route: there is an advantage in separating what you love from what you do for a living, quoting Jamie Brandon’s wonderful <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/frugality-is-non-linear/">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By separating the means of earning money from the freedom you are pursuing, it enables pursuing goals in that under-served intersection of valuable but not profitable. Whether that’s supporting free software, producing art, or home-schooling your children, trying to fit such activities into a profitable enterprise inevitably produces uncomfortable compromises which can be avoided by removing the need to earn money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the people, like myself, are probably going down the two-job route right now (although, sadly, many of them have an overwhelming day-job that leaves them no time for their true hobbies). </p>
<p>Even if you decide to go down this path, it does not mean that you’d pick your day job randomly. You’d still want a sustainable and interesting job. There are some critical aspects to consider that may make your day job a more enjoyable one rather than a shitty one.</p>
<h1 id="Some-important-aspects-of-a-job"><a href="#Some-important-aspects-of-a-job" class="headerlink" title="Some important aspects of a job"></a>Some important aspects of a job</h1><h2 id="Industry-matters"><a href="#Industry-matters" class="headerlink" title="Industry matters"></a>Industry matters</h2><p>The speed at which an industry expands would greatly impact your career path. In an industry of higher order of growth, you are much likely to be promoted to a more senior role earlier, since the business is fast expanding and there are new senior roles being created constantly. In a rather stagnant business (or institution), senior roles would only become available when the predecessor leaves his job (for example, professorships in a university). </p>
<p>Working in a rather stagnant industry also means that there is a higher risk of losing your job, since if an industry has stopped expanding, it may be very likely already stepping downhills. And if you lose your job in your middle or late adulthood, your skill set may not be very well transferable to other expanding industries. Loss of the source of income might become a serious issue when you are older.</p>
<p>Another less apparent downside of staying in a rather stagnant industry is that it is probably less exciting than the fast-expanding industries, and the people that you work with are probably not of the brightest and most interesting kind.</p>
<h2 id="Time-horizon-matters"><a href="#Time-horizon-matters" class="headerlink" title="Time horizon matters"></a>Time horizon matters</h2><p>“Where do you foresee yourself in 10 years’ time” is a commonly used question in interviews for evaluating a candidate’s general job prospects. When choosing a job, it is important to look at the potential career path at a longer time horizon (10 years could be a good starting point). You’d want to start at the right place from the start since switching from one industry to another may incur potential costs.</p>
<p>Having a long-term mindset also mean that starting pay does not matter that much. If you work in the right profession, you may get promoted faster than working in a profession that you don’t fit very well.</p>
<h2 id="Personality-matters"><a href="#Personality-matters" class="headerlink" title="Personality matters"></a>Personality matters</h2><p>Do you consider yourself an independent or a conventional thinker? This may affect the type of job that you’d enjoy doing. For this matter, I would redirect you to Paul’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/think.html">post</a> on the difference between an independent or a conventional thinker, without reinventing the wheels.</p>
<p>Another aspect of personality that may affect your career path is the <em>pace of work</em>. Can you survive a fast-paced working environment? Or would you prefer working through stuff more at your own pace? Some professions do require you to work at a very fast pace (e.g. high-frequency trading), while some others would allow you more freedom in terms of when and where, or at what pace, you’d like to work (e.g. certain types of research or programming jobs).</p>
<h1 id="Ending-thoughts"><a href="#Ending-thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Ending thoughts"></a>Ending thoughts</h1><p>Ideally, a job should not only support you financially but also be spiritually fulfilling. However, such jobs are usually hard to find. Those who knew what they want to do for life right from the beginning are pretty lucky, while most people may not be able to do what they love the most as their career. But not being able to do what your love as your job should not interfere with your being able to live a happy life.</p>
